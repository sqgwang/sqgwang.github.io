Hi, I am a Post-doctoral Fellow from [Human Communication, Learning, and Development Unit](https://web.edu.hku.hk/unit/human-communication-learning-and-development), the University of Hong Kong. My research interest includes hearing cognitive science, tele-audiology, and speech perception in noise.

My work and research
======
My current primary focus is on exploring the potential of the integrated digit-in-noise test (iDIN) in evaluating hearing and cognitive function. I hope to find improved testing formats that will allow DIN to have broader applications in both clinical settings and research. Additionally, I am interested in the development of hearing care services through AI chatbots based on large language models and am conducting some explorations in this area. Lastly, as a new generation audiologist in China, I am also committed to promoting the development of audiology and the professionalization of audiologists in China.

My background and history
======

I received my Ph.D. in Hearing Science from [the University of Hong Kong](https://web.edu.hku.hk/unit/human-communication-learning-and-development), an MSc in Clinical Audiology from [the University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/audiology-with-clinical-placement-masters-msc), and a BSc in Audiology from [Zhejiang Chinese Medical University](https://www.zcmu.edu.cn/english/). During my BSc and MSc studies, I received training as an audiologist and worked as a clinical audiologist in Singapore and Beijing for several years after graduating from my MSc. During my Ph.D. studies, I spent half a year as a visiting student at [the Deep Hearing Lab](https://www.deephearinglab.com/home) in the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at the University of Cambridge.
